## Capstone 1 - Predict Future Sales
**Problem**

In this project we will work with a challenging time-series dataset consisting of daily sales data,
kindly provided by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company.
We have to predict total sales for every product and store in the next month.

**Client** 

Russian software firms - 1C Company

**Data Set**

We are provided with daily historical sales data. The task is to forecast the total amount of
products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly
changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations.
